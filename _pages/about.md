I'm a second year PhD student working with Jeff Flanigan at UC Santa Cruz.

You can reach me at `<firstname> at ucsc dot edu` or by clicking the mail button at the top left.

### research interests
I have a wide range of interests, but primarily work on fundamental problems in NLP such as
compositionality and reasoning. Currently I am working on a project in autoformalization of
mathematics into a formal language like Lean.

I also enjoy learning math and try my best to incorporate what I learn into my research, as I think
it makes for more intuitive and perhaps more interpretable AI models.
