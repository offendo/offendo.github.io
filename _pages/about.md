I'm a first year PhD student working with Jeff Flanigan at UC Santa Cruz. I have a wide range of
interests, but primarily work on fundamental problems in NLP such as compositionality and reasoning.
Currently I am working on a project in autoformalization of mathematics into a formal language like
Lean.

I also enjoy learning math and try my best to incorporate what I learn into my research, as I think
it makes for more intuitive and perhaps more interpretable AI models. 

You can reach me at `<firstname> at ucsc dot edu` or click the mail button at the top left. 

Things I like include:
  * Cooking & Baking
  * Video games of many sorts. Some favorites are 
      - Dark Souls
      - Return of the Obra Dinn
      - Outer Wilds
  * Formula 1
  * Star Wars (and Trek, and sci-fi in general)
  * Reading. Some favorites are
      - *Discworld* Series (or anything by Terry Pratchett)
      - *Lord of the Rings* et al. (J.R.R. Tolkien)
      - Imperial Radch Trilogy (Ann Leckie)
      - *Dune* (Frank Herbert)
      - Many *Star Wars* books
