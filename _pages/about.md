I'm a first year PhD student working with Jeff Flanigan at UC Santa Cruz.

### research interests
I have a wide range of interests, but primarily work on fundamental problems in NLP such as
compositionality and reasoning. Currently I am working on a project in autoformalization of
mathematics into a formal language like Lean.

I also enjoy learning math and try my best to incorporate what I learn into my research, as I think
it makes for more intuitive and perhaps more interpretable AI models.

### hobbies

- Cooking & Baking
- Video games of many sorts. Some favorites are
  - Dark Souls (et al.)
  - Return of the Obra Dinn
  - Outer Wilds

  - _Imperial Radch_ Trilogy (Ann Leckie)
  - _Dune_ (Frank Herbert)
  - Many _Star Wars_ books
