I'm a second year PhD student working with Jeff Flanigan at UC Santa Cruz. Previously I worked at
Amazon AI with the AGI team on problems in open-domain QA. Previously previously I worked on
computer vision, specifically semantic segmentation with Piyush Kumar at CGI. 

You can reach me at `<firstname> at ucsc dot edu` or by clicking the mail button at the top left.

### research interests
I have a wide range of interests, but primarily work in the intersection of mathematics and AI/NLP
on problems such as automated theorem proving and autoformalization. Currently I am working on a
project in autoformalization of mathematics into a formal language like Lean.

I also enjoy learning math and applying it in fun/novel ways to AI.
