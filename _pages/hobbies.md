### Baking
I'm not the best, but I do a lot of baking when I can find people to help me eat the goodies.

### Video games
Especially enjoy a challenge and a good story. Dark Souls, Return of the Obra Dinn, and Outer Wilds
are some recent(ish) favorites of mine.

### Reading
* _Discworld_ (or anything by Terry Pratchett)
* _Lord of the Rings_ et al. (J.R.R. Tolkien)
* _Imperial Radch_ Trilogy (Ann Leckie)
* _Dune_ (Frank Herbert)
* Many _Star Wars_ books

### Other stuff
* Formula 1
* I enjoy space operas (e.g., Star Wars) and a lot of sci-fi
* I play Dungeons & Dragons (and a few other TTRPGs)
